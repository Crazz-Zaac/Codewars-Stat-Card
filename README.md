# Codewars Stat Badge/Card (WiP) 
This is not the original Codewars Badge, just a redesign I made for fun. Any suggestions are welcome üòä


### Good to know
1. ‚ö† This app is deployed on Heroku and it has a limit of 50 concurrent conections so, If you like it please üôè clone the repo and deploy it on your favourite platform.

2. ![Heroku][1] + ‚òï. This app is [kaffeinated](https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/). It pings every 30 minutes to keep the dyno awake. Due to Heroku's policies for free dynos to sleep for 6 hours a day, I've set mine to fall asleepüò¥ from 1:00am to 7:00am GMT.

3. In this 6 hour span the app will take around 7 seconds to start. 

4. Because of the aggressive cache of github camo images I've set the headers to `no-store`, this prevents github from cahcing the image but it also prevents the image from showing when Heroku's dyno are asleep, to fix this just refresh the page. (If you know a solution to this please let me know)
